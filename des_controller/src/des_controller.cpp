/**
 * @name        des_display.cpp
 * @description Runs in the background, operates the state machine
 *              for the controller, and directly maintains the persistent data and status for the controller. It
 *              should have separate functions for the state handler for each state. Each state handler should
 *              perform the actions required for that state, send a message to the des_display program to
 *              update the display (as required), and then check the exit conditions for that state. When an
 *              exit condition is met, the state handler should return the function pointer for the next state
 *              handler. The des_controller program should print out its process id when it first starts up
